# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:** Ocean's 11.
- **Why I chose this movie:** It's my favorite movie.

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:** Tension and wonder. 

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  A Casino and a guy in a suit with sunglasses.
- **Why this element:**  The climax of the movie happens at a Casino, and the guy in the suit is the main character.

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:** I do not want a super realistic image, I want it to be very minimalist in color scheme.

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):** Black/White
- **Accent color(s):** Red
- **Overall mood:** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright) Stark / lots of dissonance

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  Wide shot of the Casino
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure) 
- [ ] Object/symbol centered 
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:**  Wide Shot of the Casino, people in the foreground or in the Casino.

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  I need to make a movie poster for the movie Oceans 11 (2001). Its a wide shot of Benedict's Casino, with people in the forgroud.I do not want a super realistic image, I want it to be very minimalist in color scheme, the main colors being black, white, and red.

- **What worked:**  It was the right idea, with the minimalism and outlines of people, and it was centered on the Casino.
- **What didn't work:**  It has too much black, and I don't want so much negative space next to the casino.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I will specify I don't want as much black, add some blue, and I want the casino AS the background. Plus, I want the people running out of the building.

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  I don't want as much black and I want the casino AS the background.  Plus, instead of saying Benedict's' casino, it could have the name of the movie, but still with people in the foreground running out of the building. 

- **What worked:**  It has the people running out of the building, as I requested
- **What didn't work:**  It went realistic, which, as I mentioned in the first prompt, I didn't want.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:** I will specify I want the same minimalism we saw in the first one.

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a poster with the red, white, and black color scheme, in which the casino says the name of the movie (oceans 11). Also, the 11 people running out of the building should be in SWAT gear, so that you cant' see their faces, and carrying duffle bags.

- **What worked:** It was 90 percent correct, with people running out of the casino and the color scheme.
- **What didn't work:**  he people in SWAT gear didn't look at all the way it did in the movie
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I will make more specific my prompt about the SWAT gear

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a poster with the red, white, and black color scheme, in which the casino says the name of the movie (oceans 11). Also, the 11 people running out of the building should be in SWAT gear, so that you cant' see their faces, and carrying duffle bags. In the swat gear they have face sheilds that are green, so you can't see their faces

- **What worked:**  It understood that only their faces were covered by the green shield, and not their entire body/
- **What didn't work:**  It looks very flat, as none of the buildings or people are at an angle/

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?) I Have selected Trial 4, as it is the most like the movie, and scored the highest in my rubric.

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  Made the building at an angle.
2. Made the people at an angle
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  
All the time, I wanted the same color scheme. However, it sometimes misunderstood what I was saying, for example when I said to put the people at an angle, it made them all run to the side.


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  
The decision to make the color scheme.

**What would you do differently next time?**  
I would add more reference images
